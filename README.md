# ReconWhore v1.0
# Author: @NSR

# Some of "Found!" result is wrong/incorrect
Edit "grep -o 'sometexthere' ; echo $?" to fix the problem

Find usernames, legal names, emails, phone, address (majority untested)...etc  iterate across countless social networks, public records, even adult sites!
This is useful if you are running an investigation to determine the usage of the same username+email+name on different social networks or public records searches.



## TODO:

- [ ] Alphabetize the checks
- [ ] Add the website name to the created document
- [ ] Add more checks
- [ ] Possibly add in controlled variations?
- [ ] Add triple (maybe more?) checking to determine which are false-positives, or false negatives
- [ ]
