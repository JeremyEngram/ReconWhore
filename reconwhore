===========================================================
  ReconWhore v1.5
       Refactored from userecon, ReconWhore cross-references 
       multiple OSINT-based datapoints for person-based 
       recon including usernames, legal names, email, social 
       networks, and extends to adult sites, members-only 
       content sites, public records, and more!
===========================================================
Scans a username and cross-references across multiple adult
social networks to validate that person as being active or 
otherwise inconsistent catfish/fake/stalker/trolling...
If accounts are found, it redundantly attempts to pull 
personally posted content from their account with any 
personally identifiable information from various sources 
such as age/dob/phone/addresses.
